First, a bit about me. I'm from Round Rock Texas, I'm an enthusiastic ball of energy, I love cats, anime, video games, listening to/making music, singing, acting and of course, coding! So, hi! 

Edit: Apparently this blog only shows my real name, so lemme explain the title of my blog. My username on Learn.co (as well as most other things) is Directrix777. Usually, people in online games refer to me as Trix, since Directrix is a bit long, and calling me Direct just feels wierd. So, this is Coding Trix. Trix is coding, and Trix has a few tricks you can use to code also. That's the title. Now back to the post

Ever since I was little, I'd loved video games, from Jumpstart World Kindergarten (SUPER old, and obscure educational PC game. I loved it as a kid) to Celeste.(SUPER fun! Highly recommended! It's an amazingly designed simple 2D platformer. (Pretty sure it's available on every major platform? I played it on the Switch.)) I think it was around 3rd grade when I played my first Mario game, New Super Mario Bros. for the DS. I'm pretty sure that's around the time I started wondering how such games were made, and started formulating ideas of someday making a game of my own. Since then, I've always had a growing interest in computers, coding, and game design. I took some courses on coding in highschool, so I know the basics of coding. Right now, learning a new language for me is just a manner of familiarizing myself with the syntax, and learning anything specific to that language. I'm sure things will get more difficult as we advance through the program, and I'm ready to face that challenge head on! (In case you can't tell, I'm SUPER hyped!)

Is this a coding trick? I mean, maybe? Does learning about coding in highschool count as a trick? Does my description of me doing it count as teaching you that trick, if it is one? I guess it's up to you. That's why this trick is the 0th one instead of the 1st(but also because of programmer counting). So if this is just a blog that I write in for a grade and no one sees it afterwards, that's fine, but hopefully this will actually be helpful to someone. If that ends up being the case...You're welcome in advance? I dunno lol.

Also here's a pic of me irl. XD Jk.
